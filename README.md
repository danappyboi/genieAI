# GenieAI
For the 2024-2025 CMU Spirit Booth, an AI representing the Genie from Aladdin was created to grant wishes for guests in the booth. The general flow is depicted as follows:

Most of the code (and graphic) were copied from the [AssemblyAI Repo](https://github.com/smithakolan/AssemblyAI-AI-Voice-Bot/blob/main/app.py), much of my work was adding keyboard functionality and creating the Genie's voice. 

Getting MPV and portaudio to work was a pain but that's a problem for a later me to write the solution for.
